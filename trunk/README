Coordinates Form Field for Django Admin
=======================================

This is the first approach to give admins a nice interface for geographical
data. With the included CoordinatesFormField it is possible to add and edit
GPS coordinates using one of the popular map services from Google and Yahoo.

Since most of the work is done via Javascript it has a nice fallback with
a default TextField. The javascript code is written with generalisation in
mind to handle the differences between the map systems.

How to use it in your own django application
============================================

1. Copy "coordinates_form.html" to a folder where it can be found by the
template loader (hint: ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` in your settings.py)

2. Set in your settings.py:
      
      ``MAP_API`` to "google", "yahoo" or "yahooflash"
      ``MAP_API_KEY`` to the API key provided by Google or Yahoo

3. Copy field.py to your django application folder, next to its models.py file

4. At the top of your applications's models.py file add the following line:
from field import CoordinatesField

5. Change the model of one of the form fields of you model, for example:

      OLD: gps = models.CharField(maxlength=75)
      NEW: gps = CoordinatesField()


What? Hm, doesn't work here. || Aaah nice, BUT...
